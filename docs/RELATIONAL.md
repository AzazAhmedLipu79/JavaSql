# Relational concepts (reference)

This project implements a minimal subset of relational operations:
- Tables (CSV with header)
- Projection (SELECT columns)
- Selection (WHERE with =, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Sorting (ORDER BY asc)
- Join (nested-loop equi-join)

See docs/usage.md and docs/queries.md for practical examples.
